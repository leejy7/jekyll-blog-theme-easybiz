## "Do Something That Matters" - P&G

<br>

### 1. Corporate Overview

P&G, which first entered South Korea in 1989 through a joint venture with Seotong Co., Ltd., established P&G Korea in 1992 separating itself from Seotong Group. P&G celebrated its 30th anniversary in Korea in 2019. Despite its long history and tradition, P&G, which dominates the global household goods market and is famous for as "The marketing academy", has been struggling in Korea due to domestic brands. Nevertheless, some brands, such as Downey, Febreze, and Gillette, are playing so well, so it's worth discussing the success strategies of them.

### 2. Business Results

#### Market Share

  <ul>
    <li><b>Textile Odor Eliminators</b>
    <br>
    Although the exact market share figures for Febreze are not available, it is certain to be the No. 1 market share for textile odor eliminators, and industry insiders believe that it occupied more than 80-90%.
    </li>
    <li><b>Razors</b>
    <br>
    It was also difficult to find accurate market share figures for Gillette. However, according to a survey of 500 adult men for "the razor brands currently in use"(multiple responses), conducted by Open Survey(a market research firm) in February 2019, Gillette (76.6 percent), Dorco (33.2 percent), and Schick (16.6 percent).
    </li>
    <li><b>Fabric Softners Market</b>
    <br>
    According to Euromonitor on the 11th of 2019, P&G's Downy took the No. 1 share of the fabric softener market. Since 2018, the game has been reversed, with Downy of P&G beating Saffron of LG Household & Health Care(a Korean national brand) to take the No. 1 market share. As of 2019, Downey's market share reached 36.1%, widening the gap with LG Household & Health Care's Saffron (31.9%), which is the second place, from 2018.
